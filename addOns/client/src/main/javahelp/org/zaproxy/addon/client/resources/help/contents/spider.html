<H1>Client Side Integration - Client Spider</H1>

This <a href="client.html">add-on</a> adds a Client Spider which is designed to explore modern web apps more effectively.
<p>
The Client Spider works in a similar way to the AJAX Spider but it has access to the DOM via the ZAP Browser Extension
which means that it can find content which the AJAX Spider cannot find.
<p>
While it is still at an early stage we believe it is a more effective approach than the AJAX Spider.
<br>
We will be focussing on improving the Client Spider and the current plan is for it to supersede the AJAX Spider
as the recommended way of crawling modern web apps.
<br>
We would appreciate feedback via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-users">ZAP User Group</a>
to let us know how effectively it works for you, especially in comparison with the AJAX Spider.

<p>
The spider can be invoked via:
<ul>
<li>Context specific "Attack" menu
<li>"Tools / Client Spider" menu item
<li>Automation Framework <a href="automation.html">spiderClient</a> job
</ul>
