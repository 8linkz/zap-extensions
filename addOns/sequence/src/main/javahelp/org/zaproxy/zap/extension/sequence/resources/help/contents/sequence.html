<H1>Sequence Scanner</H1>
This add-on facilitates the recording and scanning sequences of requests. 
In some web applications it is necessary for particular events or pages to be accessed or completed in a certain order.
By recording a sequence and then scanning it, it is possible to ensure such flows happen in an expected manner.
<p>
This add-on supports the <a href="automation.html">Automation Framework</a>.

<H2>Creating Sequences</H2>
<p>
One sequence script should be created for each multi-step operation in the application/site being tested.
</p>
There are several options for creating sequences:
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Use the Automation Framework <a href="automation.html">sequence-import</a> job.
<li>Use the Import menu item Import HAR as Sequence.
<li>In either the Sites tree or History tab select the requests you wish to have included, right click, and 
use "Add To Zest Script" (either choosing to create a new script or adding to an existing Sequence script).</li>
<li>From the main tool bar, use the "Record a New Zest Script..." button, selecting "Sequence" as the type.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Assertions</h3>
When importing the sequences it is possible to choose to create assertions for each HTTP message of the sequence:
<ul>
<li>Assert Status Code - asserts that the replayed HTTP message has the same status code.
<li>Assert Length - asserts that the replayed HTTP message has the same response body length, within the margin (percentage) specified.
</ul>

<H2>Scanning</H2>

You can active scan sequences via:
<ul>
<li>The "Sequence" tab in the Active Scan dialog - this is only visible when "Show advanced options" is selected.
<li>The context menu "Active Scan Sequence" option on the top node of a Sequence script.
<li>The Automation Framework <a href="automation.html">sequence-activeScan</a> job.
</ul>

For Example:<br>

<H2>Reporting</H2>
The following reports can include sequence scanning results:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/addons/report-generation/report-traditional-json/">Traditional JSON Report</a>.
<li><a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/addons/report-generation/report-traditional-json-plus/">Traditional JSON Report with Requests and Responses</a>.
</ul>
